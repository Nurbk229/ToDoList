# ToDoList

In this assignment, you will practice using SQLite APIs to store and manage structured data in your app.
You will modify the ToDo app in Assignment 9 so that the ToDos item will be saved permanently in the device storage.
You will also add delete and update functions to allow the user to delete and update existing ToDo items.
Optional: you can also add a search box to allow the user to search the existing database by title.
After completing this assignment you should better understand how to use the SQLite database to save your app data.
